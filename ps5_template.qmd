## Submission Steps (10 pts)
1. This problem set is a paired problem set.
2. Play paper, scissors, rock to determine who goes first. Call that person *Partner 1*.
    - Partner 1 (name and cnet ID):
    - Partner 2 (name and cnet ID):
3. Partner 1 will accept the `ps5` and then share the link it creates with their partner. You can only share it with one partner so you will not be able to change it after your partner has accepted.

## Step 1: Develop initial scraper and crawler

### 1. Scraping (PARTNER 1)

```{python}

```

  
### 2. Crawling (PARTNER 1)

```{python}

```

## Step 2: Making the scraper dynamic

### 1. Turning the scraper into a function 

* a. Pseudo-Code (PARTNER 2)

### 1. Map by State (PARTNER 1)

```{python}

```


### 2. Map by District (PARTNER 2)

```{python}

```

## Extra Credit
